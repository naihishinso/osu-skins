# osu! Skins
Contains downloadable osu! skins I make when I'm bored. These are completely free to use and requite no credit whatsoever.

# Instructions for Download
1. Click on any of the download links provided and you will be redirected to the site where the file is being hosted.
2. If you choose to install a .osz formatted file, simply download the file and open it, and the file should relocate to the osu! Skins folder.
3. If you're downloading a .zip file, simply unzip the file and do the same thing.
4. If osu! isn't already running you should have the skin. Go to your settings and head over to the Skin customization area to change it.

# Clear 1.0
A simple, clean and easy-to-follow modern-looking skin that's designed to be easy on the eyes. Several reworks have gone into this skin such as altering slider body visibility to make circles placed under sliders much more visible.

All gamemodes including osu!standard, osu!taiko, osu!catch and osu!mania are fully skinned, though the skin is primarily designed to be used for standard and catch gamemodes.

# Differences
**Original ver.**
The original ver. contains circle lighting for aesthetic purposes, but it may interfere with the gameplay and isn't very easy on the eyes, as seen in the first image.

**Modified ver.**
The modified ver. is exactly the same as the original ver., but the lighting is now much easier on the eyes and causes less confusion (shown in the second image). I highly recommend using the modified ver. when playing difficult maps that involve a lot jumps.
